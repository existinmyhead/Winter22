Course Description:

Data science is a combination of knowledge about algorithmic abstractions and statistical de- cision making. The knowledge of Data science brings these ideas together in the contest of the domain from which the data originate. The domain might be anything from healthcare or business or social science to astronomy or zoology.

With the increasing availability of data- companies, governments, and nonprofits are striving to convert these data into knowledge and insights. This course will provide necessary skill sets needed to handle such data. We will focus on three broad areas: inferential thinking through data visualizations, computational thinking, and real-world applications. We will learn about different data cleaning procedures together with fundamental machine learning techniques to bring stories behind the data. Students will also learn how to write short programs, develop an understanding of different analytical methods- including linear regression, logistic regression, and clustering. The majority of class time will be invested to explore, analyse and discuss real-world data.
