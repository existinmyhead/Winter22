Course: Applied Regression Analysis

Course Description:

We will discuss one of the most fundamental supervised statistical learning tool: linear re- gression. Major topics covered are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. Ample amount of class time will be invested to discuss about the use, mis-use and limitations of statistical models. Different procedures of variable selection and process of analyzing residuals will be emphasized. We will extensively use computer software to analyze data with emphasis on interpretability and reproducibility. A software called “R” is a major computing workhorse for this course.
